    <h2>Group Feedback:</h2>

    <p>I think that the group did very well presenting their topic to the class. All of the presenters were very clear and engaged the audience through eye contact and cracking jokes. The powerpoint itself was a little hard to read at times. For example, the colour yellow was used for some text, which made it very hard to read. I would recommend not using that colour for a powerpoint in the future and instead use something like a black or dark blue. The instructions for the assignments were a little hard to understand at first, however once the group did a demonstration of what they were looking for, it made things much more clear.</p> Keep up the good work.

<h1>Hard Challenge</h1>
<h2>Chicken Mingle</h2>

<p>At first glance the Chicken Mingle page definitely needs some work. The header itself (Chicken Mingle) is too dark and blends into the background. The 'sign up' text is not centered within the button. And the nav bar would look better if it went across the full page. The logo although adorable takes up too much space within the header, which is squishing the header and the sudhead. In order to fix these things, I would recommend choosing a different colour for the header such as a white or black. I would make the logo smaller and place it closer to the header on the right of the screen. I would also try bringing the nav bar up to the top of the page, and separate the tabs in their own boxes. I would also recommend centering the words 'sign up' within its container. And lastly, try using consistent colours that compliment each other such as blue, red, white, black, and yellow. There is a lot to look at on the webpage, so try to be more minimalistic by cutting out text such as the "bok, bok cock-a-doodle-doo" that can be distracting to users and making things more centered in the page. This way the user will not be overwhelmed by what to look at, and their focus will be more on the middle of the page where both the chicken photo and sign up button are placed.</p>
